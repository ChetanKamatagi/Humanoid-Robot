Welcome to the repository of our innovative **Maya 3.0 Humanoid Robot Project**. This project is an advanced continuation of our Autonomous Mobile Robot (AMR) project, integrating sophisticated features to create a versatile humanoid robot.

## üåü Project Overview

Our humanoid robot, Maya 3.0, builds upon the AMR foundation, adding an upper torso with advanced capabilities such as face tracking, person identification, NLP integration, and more. Maya 3.0 can operate both independently and in conjunction with the AMR base, acting as a master to command the AMR.

### Key Components:
- **Face Tracking**: Follows faces for interaction.
- **Person Identification**: Identifies and recognizes individuals.
- **Person Following**: Follows designated individuals.
- **NLP Integration**: Integrated with ChatGPT for natural language processing.
- **Battery Level Indication**: Monitors and displays battery status.
- **Tour Guide**: Provides guidance and information to visitors.
- **Hand Gestures**: Recognizes and responds to hand gestures.
- **5 DOF Arms**: Equipped with Dynamixel motors and magnetic grippers.
- **1 DOF Neck**: Allows head movements.
- **Face Expressions**: Capable of displaying facial expressions.
- **Control Interface**: User interface to control the robot.
- **Indicator Lights**: Located in the ears and around the AMR for status indication and aesthetic appeal.

### Software Stack:
- **Robot Operating System (ROS)**: Core software framework for communication and control.
- **Jetson Nano**: Computing platform for the AMR.
- **Jetson Xavier**: Primary computing platform for Maya 3.0.
- **Arduino**: Motor control and sensor integration.
- **Simulation Tools**: SolidWorks model transformed into URDF file, simulated in RViz and Gazebo with ROS.

## üéØ Features

- **Autonomous Navigation**: AMR base for precise movement and obstacle avoidance.
- **Advanced Interaction**: Face tracking, person identification, and NLP for dynamic interaction.
- **Gesture Recognition**: Detects and responds to hand gestures.
- **Tour Guide Capability**: Engages with visitors, providing tours and information.
- **Versatile Movement**: 5 DOF arms with Dynamixel motors and magnetic grippers for object manipulation.
- **Depth Perception**: 3D cameras for capturing depth information of the environment and individuals.
