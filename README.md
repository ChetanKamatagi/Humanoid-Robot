- **Battery Level Indication**: Monitors and displays battery status.
- **Tour Guide**: Provides guidance and information to visitors.
- **Hand Gestures**: Recognizes and responds to hand gestures.
- **5 DOF Arms**: Equipped with Dynamixel motors and magnetic grippers.
- **1 DOF Neck**: Allows head movements.
- **Face Expressions**: Capable of displaying facial expressions.
- **Control Interface**: User interface to control the robot.
- **Indicator Lights**: Located in the ears and around the AMR for status indication and aesthetic appeal.

### Software Stack:
- **Robot Operating System (ROS)**: Core software framework for communication and control.
- **Jetson Nano**: Computing platform for the AMR.
- **Jetson Xavier**: Primary computing platform for Maya 3.0.
- **Arduino**: Motor control and sensor integration.
- **Simulation Tools**: SolidWorks model transformed into URDF file, simulated in RViz and Gazebo with ROS.

## 🎯 Features

- **Autonomous Navigation**: AMR base for precise movement and obstacle avoidance.
- **Advanced Interaction**: Face tracking, person identification, and NLP for dynamic interaction.
